# Events

**Lift** provides three attributes to help you manage your model's **events**.

## Listener

The `Listener` attribute allows you to register a listener function for model events.

A more convenient way of registering a listener function "replacing" laravels event closures for eloquent models, more info (Laravel Docs: Eloquent Closures)[https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/eloquent#events-using-closures]

### Usage

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use WendellAdriel\Lift\Attributes\Events\Listener;
use WendellAdriel\Lift\Lift;

final class Product extends Model
{
    use Lift;


    #[Listener]
    public function onCreated(Product $product) {
    	Log::info("Product {$product->name} has been created.");
    }
}
```

### API

```php
#[Listener(event: 'created', queue: true)]
```

`event` needs to be one of Laravel's model event e.g: 'created', 'creating', 'updated'. If you set `queue` to true your handler will be executed async by Laravel's queue system. 

## Observer

The `Observer` attribute allows you to register a observer class for model events.

This is used to register a Observer Class with a model explained in more detail here: (Laravel Docs: Eloquent Observers)[https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/eloquent#observers]

### Usage

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use WendellAdriel\Lift\Attributes\Events\Observer;
use WendellAdriel\Lift\Lift;


#[Observer(ProductObserver::class)]
final class Product extends Model
{
    use Lift;

}
```

### API

```php
#[Observer(string $observer)]
```

With this attribute you can register a (`observer`)[https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/eloquent#observers] to your model, in theory you could register as many observer classes as you want.

## Dispatches

The `Dispatches` attribute allows you to dispatch custom (Laravel Events)[https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/events#defining-events].


### Usage

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use WendellAdriel\Lift\Attributes\Events\Observer;
use WendellAdriel\Lift\Lift;


#[Dispatches(ProductSaved::class)]
#[Dispatches(ProductHasBeenSetup::class, 'created')]
final class Product extends Model
{
    use Lift;

}
```

### API

```php
#[Dispatches(string $eventClass, string $event = '')]
```

`event` needs to be one of Laravel's model event e.g: 'created', 'creating', 'updated', but is optional if your (`eventClass`)[https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/events#defining-events] contains the event string in its name like `ProductSaved`, `saved` will be interpreted as the event.
